# ITSC 1213 - Problem Solve 6 - Part 1
## **1. Understanding the `Player` Class**
### **Attributes**
- What attributes (fields) does the `Player` class have? Describe their purpose.
  - 

### **Methods**
- What does the `attack()` method do? What parameter does it take?
  - 
- How does the `takeDamage()` method modify the player's state?
  - 
- What does the `isAlive()` method return, and how is it used?
  - 

### **General Understanding**
- How do players interact with monsters in this game?
  - 
- What do you think will happen when a player's `hp` reaches 0?
  -

## **2. Understanding the `Monster` Class**
### **Attributes**
- What attributes does the `Monster` class have? How do they compare to the attributes of `Player`?
  - 

### **Methods**
- How is the `attack()` method similar to the one in `Player.java`? How is it different?
  - 
- What happens when the `takeDamage()` method is called on a monster?
  - 
- How does the `isAlive()` method work in the Monster class?
  - 

### **General Understanding**
- How do monsters interact with players in this game?
  - 
- What do you predict will happen when a monster's `hp` reaches 0?
  -

## **3. Comparing `Player` and `Monster` Classes**
- List two similarities between `Player` and `Monster` classes.
  - 
- List two differences between `Player` and `Monster` classes.
  - 
- Based on your understanding, what role do these classes play in the `BattleSimulation.java` file?
  -

## **4. Predictions for `BattleSimulation.java`**
- What do you think the `arePlayersAlive()` and `areMonstersAlive()` methods will do?
  - 
- Why might we need methods like `getFirstAlivePlayer()` and `getFirstAliveMonster()`?
  -
